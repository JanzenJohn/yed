* On macOS, there's a weird bug that causes a crash when yed is run in a
  directory that has a libyed.so file in it.
    * I think what is happening is that dyld is preferring the version of
      libyed.so in the cwd over the one that gets resolved with yed's rpath.
    * Not sure how to fix it... we could do some nasty hack in the driver,
      but that doesn't sound very nice.
    * UPDATE: This doesn't seem to happen on my new M1 machine, so I'm not really
      sure about this one.
* If a plugin is running any additional threads, yed will crash on reload because
  pthreads loses the code it's supposed to be running
* multi-line comments sometimes lose their highlighting... not sure how to repro
* still have that bug since forever where sometimes the cursor will get stuck
  in the scroll-offset zone. This one is also hard to repro
