- replace-current-search is broken for buffers with multi-column glyphs
- brace_hl is slow for large files (try the 21M gcc.c) -- make the scanning give up after some number of lines
- deleting selected ranges (I guess not line ranges) with multi-col chars is busted
    - yanking seems to work
    - try deleting the whitespace range before the word 'foozle'
