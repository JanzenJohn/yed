* some kind of version checker for plugins so that
  plugins compiled with an older version of yed
  don't cause crashes
    * we can tie this in with a system that can
      designate a version as "breaking" older
      versions
* greedy key sequences reading instead of eager
* compose key sequences
* catch SIGTERM
    * exit gracefully (don't leave the terminal messed up)
* macro plugin
* revamped command line
    * history (generalize)
    * more advanced editing with arrow keys, etc.
* only "live" update replace visible lines
    * maybe this can be done in a line draw event handler
      where we change the contents?
* more completion (generalize)
    * command line
    * commands: buffer, plugin stuff, style stuff
    * files (for use in command line and completer plugin)
* buffer-mod changes
    * event trigger moved to the actual buffer
      modification functions
    * default event handler that sets "modified" flag on
      buffers
    * make 'quit' check the flags and ask
      if you really want to quit without saving
* meta keys in core (fn keys too?)
* OSC 52
* bucket_array_rtraverse{_from}
    * use in yed_find_prev()
* macOS compatibility
    * installation uses some stuff that macOS doesn't have (readelf, different dd flags)
    * I think I encountered a crash... not sure
