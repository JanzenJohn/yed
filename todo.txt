* greedy key sequences reading instead of eager
* compose key sequences
    * seems like if you have greedy, you don't need to compose?
* revamped command line
    * history (generalize)
    * more advanced editing with arrow keys, etc.
* only "live" update replace visible lines
    * maybe this can be done in a line draw event handler
      where we change the contents?
* more completion (generalize)
    * command line
    * commands: buffer, plugin stuff, style stuff
    * files (for use in command line and completer plugin)
* buffer-mod changes
    * event trigger moved to the actual buffer
      modification functions
    * default event handler that sets "modified" flag on
      buffers
    * make 'quit' check the flags and ask
      if you really want to quit without saving
* OSC 52
* bucket_array_rtraverse{_from}
    * use in yed_find_prev()
* macOS compatibility
    * installation uses some stuff that macOS doesn't have (readelf, different dd flags)
    * I think I encountered a crash... not sure
* regex support
    * use POSIX stuff for now; maybe write our own in the future
* actually accurate vim emulation plugin (vym)
* make style_picker use the new 'special-buffer-prepare-*' stuff
* yedrc should be able to read multi-line strings with backslashed at the end
* direct draws have a bug where if they are drawn over an area that doesn't have any content,
  then they don't get killed properly
    * they get killed, but they don't get drawn over by anything else, so it looks like they stick around
