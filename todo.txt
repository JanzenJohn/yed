* On macOS, there's a weird bug that causes a crash when yed is run in a
  directory that has a libyed.so file in it.
    * I think what is happening is that dyld is preferring the version of
      libyed.so in the cwd over the one that gets resolved with yed's rpath.
    * Not sure how to fix it... we could do some nasty hack in the driver,
      but that doesn't sound very nice.
    * UPDATE: This doesn't seem to happen on my new M1 machine, so I'm not really
      sure about this one.
* If a plugin is running any additional threads, yed will crash on reload because
  pthreads loses the code it's supposed to be running
* multi-line comments sometimes lose their highlighting... not sure how to repro
    * it seems to happen when a multi-line highlight is cut off by the bottom of the
      frame and then we scroll the buffer (because we've hit the scroll offset)
      (so, something to do with redrawing the whole frame)
* still have that bug since forever where sometimes the cursor will get stuck
  in the scroll-offset zone. This one is also hard to repro
* only "live" update replace visible lines
    * maybe this can be done in a line draw event handler
      where we change the contents?
* buffer-mod changes
    * event trigger moved to the actual buffer
      modification functions
    * default event handler that sets "modified" flag on
      buffers
    * make 'quit' check the flags and ask
      if you really want to quit without saving
* OSC 52
* macOS compatibility
    * installation uses some stuff that macOS doesn't have (readelf, different dd flags)
    * I think I encountered a crash... not sure
* regex support
    * use POSIX stuff for now; maybe write our own in the future
* actually accurate vim emulation plugin (vym)
* direct draws have a bug where if they are drawn over an area that doesn't have any content,
  then they don't get killed properly
    * they get killed, but they don't get drawn over by anything else, so it looks like they stick around
* ys->current_search is a leak-fest -- fix it
