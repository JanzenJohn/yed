* line numbers
* things from vimrc
    * alignment
* some kind of version checker for plugins so that
  plugins compiled with an older version of yed
  don't cause crashes
    * we can tie this in with a system that can
      designate a version as "breaking" older
      versions
* greedy key sequences reading instead of eager
* compose key sequences
* catch SIGTERM -- exit gracefully (don't leave the terminal messed up)
* async behavior by making yed_read_keys() non-blocking
    * catch SIGINT in read to execute queued tasks?
