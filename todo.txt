* line numbers
* some kind of version checker for plugins so that
  plugins compiled with an older version of yed
  don't cause crashes

      designate a version as "breaking" older
      versions
* greedy key sequences reading instead of eager
* compose key sequences
* catch SIGTERM -- exit gracefully (don't leave the terminal messed up)
* async behavior by making yed_read_keys() non-blocking
    * catch SIGINT in read to execute queued tasks?
* there's a bug in syntax highlighters that's causing the `last_was_...`
  things to not be highlighted if there's a single preceding space
